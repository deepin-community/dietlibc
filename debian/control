Description: diet libc - a libc optimized for small size
 The diet libc is a C library that is optimized for small size. It
 can be used to create small statically linked binaries for Linux
 on alpha, ARM, hppa (PA-RISC), IA-64, MIPS, PowerPC, S/390, SPARC
 and x86 under GPLv2.
 .
 This package is used to compile programs with the diet libc.
