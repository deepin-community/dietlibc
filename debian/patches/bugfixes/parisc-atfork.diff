Description: Properly initialize pthread_atfork's spinlock
 On PA-RISC (due to some quirk of the instruction set) an unlocked
 spinlock is initialized with a 1, not a 0, as on other platforms. But
 pthread_atfork's spinlock wasn't properly initialized with
 PTHREAD_SPIN_UNLOCKED, instead it was just zero'd out, causing the
 code to loop endlessly on fork() whenever -lpthread was linked in.
